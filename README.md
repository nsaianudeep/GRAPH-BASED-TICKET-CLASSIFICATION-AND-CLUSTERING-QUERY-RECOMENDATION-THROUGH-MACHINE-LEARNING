# GRAPH-BASED-TICKET-CLASSIFICATION-AND-CLUSTERING-QUERY-RECOMENDATION-THROUGH-MACHINE-LEARNING
Developed a hybrid classification model integrating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost, achieving an impressive 94.37% accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Implemented clustering techniques (GMM, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative) for better insights into incident patterns, with optimal results using GMM + DBSCAN (Silhouette Score: 0.6569, Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.4614).
ðŸ”¹ Leveraged Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL for robust graph-based data representation and querying.
ðŸ”¹ Focused on improving operational efficiency, scalability, and service quality through intelligent automation.

This project bridges the gap between machine learning and real-world ITSM applications, demonstrating the potential of hybrid models and graph-based techniques in enhancing ticket management systems.
